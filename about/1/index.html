                    i'm writing⁷ a book, <i>not quite anything</i>, which is a mix of science fiction and gender theory. this is not as strange a combination as it might seem: reductively, science fiction is more or less analytic philosophy at its most artistic.

                    as ursula le guin writes, science fiction is not an attempt at extrapolation but an extended thought experiment conducted by the novelist; thus it is not predictive but descriptive. science fiction explores what it would be like if the material basis of gender was different. this, not to understand a future or alternate world, but for the insight gained into this one.

                    my academic work largely focuses on feminist & critical epistemology but often branches out into epistemology writ large. i have written on hermeneutical dilution and monumentalization, collective zetetic norms, how moral encroachment bears on sexual consent, and so on.

                    as a mathematician, i had interests in a range of fields, including combinatorics, graph theory, and classical & quantum complexity theory. i did research at stanford, brown,⁸ and northwestern, publishing in <i>discrete mathematics</i> & <i>involve</i>. i remain interested in the use of logic in epistemology and the philosophy of language. <span class="cursor">█</span>
