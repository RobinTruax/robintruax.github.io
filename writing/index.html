                    <i>not quite anything</i> is a mix of science fiction and gender theory. it is written both against essentialist conceptions of gender identity that neglect gender's material basis, and models of gender-as-class that fail to do justice to the way that the subject makes gender legible for themselves. instead, it tries to reckon with gender as an embodied transcendence, a material commitment and inescapable situation but also a possibility for radical autonomy.

                    <i>phone calls from the other side of desire</i> is a quarterly comic by nicha, who is doing most of the work but insists it's an equal collaboration, and her fianc√©e roshni. in principle, it's about whatever they have on their mind, but tends to be about intimacy and queer romance.
